# Given list of numbers
numbers = [12, 24, 35, 24, 88, 120, 155]

# Use list comprehension to filter out all occurrences of 24
# Iterates through each element x in the numbers list
# Keeps only elements where x is not equal to 24
result = [x for x in numbers if x != 24]

# Print the filtered list without 24
