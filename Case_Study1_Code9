# Given list
"""
This function removes duplicate elements from a given list while preserving the original order of elements.
Parameters:
    lst (list): The input list from which duplicates need to be removed.
Returns:
    list: A new list containing only the unique elements from the input list, in the order they first appeared.
Workflow:
1. Initialize an empty set `seen` to keep track of elements that have already been encountered.
2. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the unique elements.
3. Iterate through each item in the input list `lst`.
4. For each item, check if it is not in the `seen` set:
   - If it is not, add it to the `seen` set and append it to the `result` list.
5. After processing all items, return the `result` list containing only unique elements.

"The parameter lst is called a function parameter.
"Specifically:"
"lst is the formal parameter name used in the function definition def remove_duplicates(lst):
"It represents a placeholder for the list that will be passed to the function when it's called
"When you call remove_duplicates(original_list), the argument original_list gets assigned to the parameter lst
"In this case, lst is a list parameter that allows the function to accept any list as input and process it to remove duplicates while preserving order"
