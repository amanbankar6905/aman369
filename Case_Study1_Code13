# Import the random module for generating random selections

# Generate a list of numbers divisible by both 5 and 7 (i.e., divisible by 35)
# range(35, 1001, 35) creates a sequence starting at 35, ending before 1001, with step 35
# This produces: [35, 70, 105, 140, ..., 980]
# List comprehension [n for n in ...] builds a list containing all these numbers
numbers_divisible_by_35 = [n for n in range(35, 1001, 35)]

# random.sample() selects k unique random elements from the list without replacement
# Parameters:
#   - numbers_divisible_by_35: the population to choose from
#   - 5: the number of unique elements to randomly select
# Returns a list of 5 randomly selected numbers from numbers_divisible_by_35
random_numbers = random.sample(numbers_divisible_by_35, 5)

# Print the list of 5 randomly selected numbers
